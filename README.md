### Hi ! Welcome to my GitHub profile ! ðŸ‘‹

# Who I Am?

- My name is Aurel, but you can also call me by my nickname "Traffy". 
- In short, I'm just a guy who really loves programming but also computers in general (maybe also a lazy guy who stays in his room to geek out, it all depends on your point of view). 
- My ultimate goal is to combine these two loves of my life, and become a gamedev.
